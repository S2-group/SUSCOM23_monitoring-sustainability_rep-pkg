In the following, the online appendix and its contents will be outlined.


NOTE:
===========
As this research was conducted as a case study in the context of the Schiphol Group (aviation sector),
raw data, i.e. interview transcripts and raw measurements, cannot be disclosed.
Especially safety and security-relevant data has to be omitted. Also, data revealing hostnames, etc.

CONTENTS:
===========
The package is structured according to the study design (Phase 1-3) and is complemented with further files/folders.
